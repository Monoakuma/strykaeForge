# Strykae for Forge
This repository is a recreation the Strykae Cycle from my own writings. Specifically, this mod intends to implement the Galdic and Sahvic magic systems as well as some items and mechanics related to the Strykae Cycle.
I intend to make as many features as possible editable with the config.

## Magic
Galdic and Sahvic magic relies on the player to find Sigils by exploring. Sigils can be combined into a Spell Word using a Writing Desk.
A Spell Word is comprised of the following:
* Exaggeration Sigils which increase the power and cost of the spell, if Multiple Exaggeration Sigils are added to the same Spell Word, their costs and power multiply.
* Focus Sigils which determine the exact effect that you are causing, This is the heart of the spell, it is the Fire in Fireball.
* Specifying Sigils which are appended as suffixes to the Focus, determine which exact entities, blocks, items, or other objects may be selected by the Spell Word when it is cast.
An Example Spell would be "Sid Sunnon", 'Sid' is an Exaggeration with a power/cost of 9, 'Sunn' is the focus for heat, and 'on' is the suffix for "the block or area I am looking at" So this spell would warm up the block you are looking at, thus causing a small fire.
The difference between Galdic and Sahvic magic is primarily who can use which sigils.
Only humans can use Galdic Sigils, and only strykae can use Sahvic Sigils.

Additionally, Sahvic magic increases in power with the fullness of the moon. Reaching frightening potential on the full moon but unusable on the new moon.

## The Strykae Cycle
The word "Strykae" means "to flatten", this is because strykae naturally 'flatten' the population around them.
All strykae were at one point, humans. Humans become strykae by eating another person's heart.

By becoming a Strykae you lose your humanity and can no longer use Galdic Magic. Strykae get debuffs when eating food that isn't animal based.
As you eat more hearts and thus distance yourself further from humanity you will be able to do certain actions to give yourself new abilities and new weaknesses.
Such as having Strength at night, but getting Weakness when in direct sunlight, or turning invisible in the rain but taking extra damage from fire.
